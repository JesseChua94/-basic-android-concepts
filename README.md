# Basic-Android-Features
Getting familiar with Android Studio and implementing a few basic features.

Some basic features I was playing around with was:
Activities, buttons, moving from activities, displaying the current time from a button,
labelling buttons, activity bar, themes.

Some of the changes overlapped so some functions may not work or be apparent.
This is pretty much just rough work for my introduction app. Names are not good and everything is messy.
