Getting familiar with Android Studio and a few basic concepts

Some basic concepts I was playing around with was:
Activities, buttons, moving from activities, displaying the current time from a button,
labelling buttons, activity bar, themes.

Some of the changes overlapped so some functions may not work or be apparent.
This is pretty much just rough work for my introduction app.
